### Abstract

Interest is growing rapidly in using deep learning to classify biomedical images, and interpreting these deep-learned models is necessary for life-critical decisions and scientific discovery. Effective interpretation techniques accelerate biomarker discovery and provide new insights into the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. Most interpretation techniques aim to discover spatially-salient regions within images, but few techniques consider imagery with multiple channels of information. For instance, highly multiplexed tumor and tissue images have 30-100 channels and require interpretation methods that work across many channels to provide deep molecular insights. We propose a novel channel embedding method that extracts features from each channel. We then use these features to train a classifier for prediction. Using this channel embedding, we apply an interpretation method to rank the most discriminative channels. To validate our approach, we conduct an ablation study on a synthetic dataset. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method aligns with biological findings on highly multiplexed images of breast cancer cells while outperforming baseline pipelines.
